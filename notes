Options for running

1. activate environment, then run py files:
    - navigate to confocal_processing directory
    - activate environemt: poetry shell
    - run file: python Scripts\your_script.py

    What this does
    - enter a new shell with the virtual environment fully activated. every command
      you run in this shell will use the virtual environment's python and packages.
    - good for running multiple commands in the environment

2. run command without entering shell:
    - navigate to confocal_processing directory
    - run file right away: poetry run python your_script.py

    What this does
    - you don't enter a new shell. Each command you run with "poetry run" will temporarily activate the environment just for that command.
    - good for running single commands without needing to enter a new shell

**Current problem**
works when i do option 2, but if i try option 1, i get ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'napari'
now my .toml file is not valid and i cant run anything: C:/Users/labudzki/OneDrive - AMOLF/Documents/Repositories/confocal_processing/pyproject.toml is not a valid TOML file.
TOMLDecodeError: Unclosed array (at line 18, column 5)
also poetry run your_script.py works but run-> run without debugging and also activating shell then python your_script.py dont work. both show ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'napari'
i navigate into LOCOMYCO but when i press run without debugging it goes back into Repositories

poetry
poetry add ___ : adds a package to the environment and updates pyproject.toml
poetry lock : generates or updates the poetry.lock file based on the pyproject.toml
poetry install : installs the dependencies from the poetry.lock file into the virtual environment
poetry run python your_script.py : runs a python script within the virtual environment without activating the shell


git commands:
  - git status (check status of changes)
  - git add . (add all changes)
  - git add path/to/file.py (add specific file)
  - git commit -m "message" (commit changes with message)
  - git push origin main (push changes to remote repository on main branch)
  - git commit --amend (amend last commit)
  - git reset HEAD~1 (undo last commit, keep changes staged)
  - git checkout -- path/to/file.py (discard changes in working directory for specific file)
  - git pull origin main (pull latest changes from remote main branch)
  - git pull 

  Typical workflow:
    - git pull origin main
    - git add .
    - git commit -m "descriptive message"
    - git push origin main
